### What is Standard Deviation?
Let's say we had a dataset of number of extreme weather days experienced in a year. If the mean was 15 extreme weather events, 

Standard deviation measures how spread our a set of numbers is from their mean average.

Critical tool for measuring variability and uncertainty.

ChatGPT example: If the average summer temperature is rising by 1°C but the SD increases, it means extreme heat events are becoming more likely—not just a uniform warming.

So SD gives you the nuance: “The climate isn’t just hotter—it’s less predictable"

>> Why start in the 1980s? So I can build up to the less predictable cases of the 2020s.
